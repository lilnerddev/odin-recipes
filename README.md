# 🍽️ Odin Recipes

**Odin Recipes** is a simple, static website built from the ground up using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core web development technologies in their most fundamental form.

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum — a free, open-source, and community-driven platform for learning full-stack web development.

## 🍜 Features

- A clean, multi-page recipe website built with semantic HTML
- Styled using custom CSS without any frameworks
- Simple navigation and clear structure

## 🥢 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control
- **Linux CLI** (Command Line Interface)
- **Xubuntu** (via VirtualBox)

This project was developed entirely inside a VirtualBox VM running **Xubuntu**, providing an opportunity to practice working in a Linux environment — including terminal navigation, file management, and Git usage from the command line.

## 🍬 What I Learned

- Structuring web pages using semantic HTML
- Styling pages with CSS
- Using Git for version control and pushing code to GitHub
- Navigating and managing files in a Linux environment via the terminal
