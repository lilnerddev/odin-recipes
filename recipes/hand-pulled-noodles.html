        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A life-altering noodle dish that will make your mouth water just by thinking about it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Noodles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread flour</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Black vinegar</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Chili flakes</li>
            <li>Green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 parts flour, 1 part 1 water, and 1/100th part (aka a "pinch" of) salt in a big mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix for about 5-10 minutes with chopsticks (or your hands) until a rough dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for 5-10 more minutes until it becomes more smooth.</li>
            <li>Cover dough and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While dough is resting, combine black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chilli fakes into a small bowl for the noodle sauce. Proportions of each are entirely up to your taste.</li>
            <li>Chop up the green onion and add to the sauce.</li>
            <li>After dough has rested, knead again for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Check if dough has formed a "gluten window" by holding it up to the light and stretching it thin. </li>
            <li>Separate dough into 5 thick rectangles and cover in about 1 tbsp of your favorite cooking oil to prevent the dough from sticking.</li>
            <li>Cover dough and leave in fridge for at least 1 hour. Can also cover and put sauce in fridge.</li>
            <li>When it's lunch or dinner time, remove from fridge and strength each piece into a noodle using the "bang-bang" technique of slapping it against a flat surface and stretching until it's the desired thin-ness.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water with a pinch of salt to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add your stretched noodle and cook for literally 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve cooked noodle in a bowl and top with the sauce made earlier.</li>
            <li>Top with more green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! The taste will live rent-free in your mind for the rest of your life.</li>
        </ol>
